# Trivia Game

This project is a trivia game with many different modes and questions

Choose what difficulty you would like to play at: Free, normal, hard, expert, or expert+. You may also be timed on your 
answers if you want.<br>
After you select your difficulty, I would highly recommend typing in, "help" for a list of rules, tips, and keyboard 
shortcuts.<br>
After that, you are ready to start answering questions!

Create the program, "main_game_with_run_screen"<br>
The program should include:<br>
-Imports from the programs: math_tools, tools, trivia_questions, and the module time.
-An input that asks the player for an answer to a trivia question
-A way to check if that input is valid or not
-A way to stop the program easily(without manually stopping it)
-A scoring system
